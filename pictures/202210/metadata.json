            "desc": "There are thousands of waterfalls in Yosemite National Park, but perhaps none are as well known as Bridalveil Fall. First things first: Don't call it 'falls' because then someone may think you were in Utah where another waterfall bears the surprisingly similar name, Bridal Veil Falls. Bridalveil, as seen in the photo, is often the first waterfall visitors to Yosemite encounter. It plunges 617 feet and flows year-round, fed with water from Ostrander Lake nearly 10 miles away. When the flow is light, brisk winds blow the water sideways. That's why the Ahwahneechee Native Americans, who have lived in the Yosemite Valley for centuries, traditionally called the waterfall Pohono, or 'Spirit of the Puffing Wind.'",

The now nine-day event got its start by launching 13 balloons from a shopping mall parking lot in 1972 to celebrate the birthday of a local radio station. It has easily become the biggest event of the year in Albuquerque, whose entire populace can view balloons in flight simply by stepping outside their homes and looking up.",

The 'Circle,' sculpted by Japanese artist Junkyu Muto and installed in 2008, is the third of seven 'peace sculptures' placed around the world. Twelve feet high and made of white marble, it's intended to evoke a puff of smoke from a Native American ceremonial pipe.",

This stunning fossil display is known as the Ammonite Pavement, where thousands of ammonite fossils are embedded in a limestone ledge at the west end of Monmouth Beach in Dorset. Although the ammonites look rather like snail shells, these are fossils of extinct sea creatures that are more closely related to today's octopus or squid. Britain's Natural History Museum notes that the fossil-filled ledge is unique in the world because of the sheer number and size of the ammonites: The fossils reach up to 27 inches in diameter. If you want to check them out, timing is everything—the ledge emerges at low tide, and there are more ammonites in large rocks nearby, too.",

Your answer depends on how highly you rate the ability to just laze around all day, but in honor of International Sloth Day, let's all just embrace slothfulness. If you want to live the sloth life, head outside and hang upside down in the nearest tree. You won't be able to dangle there as long as a sloth though, because they spend most of their lives doing it. Their arms, legs, hands, and feet evolved for literally 'hanging around' like the pair of Hoffmann's two-toed sloths in today's photo.",

Diwali is a five-day celebration of the symbolic victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. Diyas are a traditional symbol of the festival, and they are arranged on a rangoli, a colorful pattern made on the floor using dried rice flour, colored powdered stone, flower petals, or other colorings. Rangoli designs are more than just attractive—they're believed to attract Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth and prosperity. Each day of the festival has its own significance, but day three—called Lakshmi Puja—is considered the main event. To prepare for Lakshmi Puja, people clean their homes to welcome Lakshmi's blessings of prosperity and happiness. A rangoli design is created near the entrance to a home or building, and families pass down traditional designs from generation to generation.",
