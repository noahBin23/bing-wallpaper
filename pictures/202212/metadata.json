Inhospitable as it sounds, Antarctica, which lies almost completely below the Antarctic Circle, is also a place of stunning beauty as evidenced by this image of Paradise Harbour, aka Paradise Bay, near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. Antarctica is also extraordinarily vulnerable to the effects of climate change, worth remembering today on Antarctica Day, which marks the anniversary of the signing of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty. The international agreement protects Antarctica as a scientific preserve.",

Art Basel Miami Beach, which wraps up its three-day run today, is the American leg of an international art fair also staged in Basel, Switzerland (where the festival started in 1970), Hong Kong, and Paris. The event, now 20 years old, is the most comprehensive contemporary art fair in North America, attracting thousands of artists, dealers, collectors, appreciators, and just fun-seeking tourists for this annual burst of creativity steps from the sand.",
